When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To collaborate on a project with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Avoid unwanted merge commits between commits between github and local machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is used on github. Fork creates a copy of the repo for another user on
    the github servers but nothing is reflected on the local machine of the user.
    In order to get the forked version of the repo, the user uses clone which
    copies the entire repo along with the commit history to the local machine
    of the user.
    Branches are related to a single repo no copying of repo is done. New
    branches are extra paths added to the master branch providing flexibility
    to add new features.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This helps in knowing the state of repo on github and the changes done after
    the previous commit.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When a user wants to add a new feature in an already existing repo created by another user, he/she can fork the repo , clone it, then add new features in a new branch , commit , push and then make a pull request.
    This way the master doesn't get affected.
