How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Reduced my extra effort and save more time. Identified the additions and deletions removing the need to walkthrough entire file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can keep track of the evolution of the application. Introduce changes and revert back to working state in case we are not able find bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Reduces the no of commits. Make each commit meaningful. Helps stay with the rule 'one commit one logical change'
    cons: might lead to loss of data if we fail to commit.
    breaks the rule

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is mainly used for software development. Each file might be interrelated


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git-log - Show commit logs
    git log [<options>] [<revision range>] [[\--] <path>…​]


    git-diff - Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
    git diff [options] [<commit>] [--] [<path>…​]
    git diff [options] --cached [<commit>] [--] [<path>…​]
    git diff [options] <commit> <commit> [--] [<path>…​]
    git diff [options] <blob> <blob>
    git diff [options] [--no-index] [--] <path> <path>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Braches. They dont affect the master version. Easy to revert in case of bugs.
    Checkout can be used to change the state of the application.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Maintaining different version of a document. Develop a simple app with the code on github so i can view all the commits i made and learn the working.
